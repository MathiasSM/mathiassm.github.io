Inside this network, most of the CS undergrad and postgraduate studies is managed. Professors have their personal sites there, accounts for using services like the printers, email, storage and so on. </p>\n<p>As a newbie there, you’re not ready to handle all that; instead, you get homework to stay learning progressively, while in the meantime solving IT issues of students and faculty alike. Sometimes requests are easy, like installing an OS, or installing something, while other times it’s about fixing a printer (God I hate printers).</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-you-learn-about\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-you-learn-about\" aria-label=\"what you learn about permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What you learn about</h3>\n<p>The LDC is in charge of several basic and not-so-basic services, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mail (IMAP, SMTP)</li>\n<li>NFS</li>\n<li>LDAP</li>\n<li>Databases (Postgres, MySQL… )</li>\n<li>Logwatchers</li>\n<li>Backups (Bacula, Amanda…)</li>\n<li>DHCP</li>\n<li>DNS</li>\n<li>SSH</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some way or another, you end up learning anything from regular expressions as life savers, package managers, the OSI model, sniffing the network and just being good at getting your hands dirty in the console.</p>\n<p>I’ve completed several <em>“tareas”</em> (homework about a specific topic), but due to rules of the LDC, I can’t post them here yet.
