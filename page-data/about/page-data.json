I’m currently living in Spain and working for Amazon as an SDE.</p>\n<p>From the start of my CS studies at USB, I always picked the courses that most interested me. I chose the specializations in Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages and Databases Design and Architecture. I grew fond of the last two, specially. The rest of my time on the CS world, I’ve</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Participated in coding competitions</strong> such as ACM-ICPC and IOI,</li>\n<li><strong>Worked remotely</strong> for people in different countries and time zones,</li>\n<li><strong>Developed automation tools</strong> to make some programming tasks easier,</li>\n<li><strong>Worked as a SysAdmin</strong> in a team responsible for the University’s network,</li>\n<li><strong>Given classes</strong> to newcomers to Computer Science and Programming, and</li>\n<li><strong>Led teams</strong> of 8+ members for Software Development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I like to spend time away from code, so I watch movies, enjoy anime series and write stories from time to time. As you can see, I like stories and all forms of storytelling.</p>\n<p>I also speak Spanish, as it’s my mother tongue! I might have a few Spanish writings here and there on the site.</p>"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1962740614","2143126931","4047692483"]}
