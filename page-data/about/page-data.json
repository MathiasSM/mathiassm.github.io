I’m currently living in Spain and working for Amazon as an SDE.</p>\n<p>From the start of my CS studies at USB, I always picked the courses that most interested me. I chose the specializations in Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages and Databases Design and Architecture. I grew fond of the last two, specially. The rest of my time on the CS world, I’ve</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Been working for Amazon for 2+ years</strong> mostly improving parts of Search,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Participated in coding competitions</strong> such as ACM-ICPC and IOI,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Developed automation tools</strong> to make some programming tasks easier,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Worked as a SysAdmin</strong> in a team responsible for my University’s network,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Given classes</strong> to newcomers to Computer Science and Programming, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Led teams</strong> of 8+ members for Software Development.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I like to spend time away from code, so I watch movies, enjoy anime series and write stories from time to time. As you can see, I like stories and all forms of storytelling.</p>\n<p>I also speak Spanish, as it’s my mother tongue! I might have a few Spanish writings here and there on the site.</p>"}},"pageContext":{}},
